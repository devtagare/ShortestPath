ShortestPath
============

A shortest path algorithm has been implemented with a priority queue.

A graph with loops,has been configured from the TestShortestPath class.

Inputs for getting the shortest path given an assembled graph are the start and end destinations.

The result will be the path in-case a valid path existis.

Functionality has been provided to get the distance as well,if needed in future.
